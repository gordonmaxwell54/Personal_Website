<h2 id="aboutme"> About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Gordon Maxwell and I am 17 years old. My main intersts are playing video games, mainly fighting games like Super Smash Bros. and Stret Fighter. Sometimes I like to play platformer games like the Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog games.</p>
<p> Whenever I'm not playing video games I am watching videos on <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>. YouTube is my main source of entertainment as I do not enjoy watching traditional TV as I feel like traditional TV is repetative and boring to me. </p>
<h2>My Work</h2>
<p> This section will be dedicated to showing off all the work I have done during my time at NCN. This will feature screenshots of games that I am creating during the next 2 years as well as featuring screenshots on the creation process.
